# How to edit the LAProof documentation

1.  Edit html/index.html as you see fit.  Do not edit any files of the form html/LAProof.*, as these are automatically generated by coqdoc.

2.  Edit the comments in any of the .v files, using [Coqdoc markup](https://rocq-prover.org/doc/V8.20.0/refman/using/tools/coqdoc.html).

3.  `make html` creates all the Coqdoc output in the html/ directory.  Browse and review these local files and edit the .v files until this looks the way you want it.

4.  `make publish` sends all those html files (including index.html if you have edited it) to the Github pages site at https://verinum.org/LAProof/.  The way it does this is by committing them to the special gh-pages branch of this repo, which contains _only_ a docs directory with those HTML files.

5.  Don't forget to git-commit and git-push all your changes in the main branch (or whatever branch you're working in).
